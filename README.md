fraud-detection 
This project explores the development of a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent transactions are often rare, leading to class imbalance issues addressed through techniques like SMOTE. The analysis highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and algorithm selection for better accuracy. Models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting exhibited high performance, showcasing their suitability for fraud detection tasks. Evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC and F1-score demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in minimizing false positives and negatives. Future improvements could involve deploying deep learning techniques or real-time systems for enhanced fraud detection efficiency.
